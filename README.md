# PROG2
This repo will store all of my projects which were created during SS 24/25 in uni.
I have learned lots of things this semester.
Mainly, how to work with the C language — including pointers and memory management.
I also improved my debugging skills and started understanding how low-level programming works.
Overall, this semester helped me feel more confident in solving technical problems and writing cleaner code.

## Assignment 0 
The goal of this assignment was to write a simple C program that prints the prime factors of a given number.  
It was as an introductory task to help us understand how the submission system works.

## Assignment 1 
The aim of this task was to write a C program that displays a formatted table with calculated values of artificial neuron activation functions.  
We practiced mathematical operations, floating-point numbers, functions, loops, and output formatting.  
This assignment is part of a larger project focused on developing software for recognizing handwritten digits using a neural network.

## Assignment 2
The goal of this assignment was to implement a basic neural network to classify handwritten digit images from the MNIST database.  
We worked on core operations of neural networks and evaluated the model’s performance in classifying multiple images.

## Assignment 3
In this task, we developed a console-based word processor that processes loaded lines of text using a set of commands.

## Assignment 4
This assignment involved writing a console application that simulates a battle between two armies.  
Each army consists of combat units equipped with items from an item database.  
The user configures both armies before the duel starts.  
The battle is turn-based and proceeds in rounds, with units attacking using their equipped items.  
The simulation ends with either a victory or a draw.

## Assignment 5
This was an extension of Assignment 4.  
We added the ability to load items and combat units from external text files.  
Objects were loaded from a JSON file, while combat units were loaded from TXT files.  
The focus was also on robust error handling during file loading.
